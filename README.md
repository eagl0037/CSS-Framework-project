## CSS Framework Project
Overview
Welcome to the CSS Framework Project! This framework is designed to provide a robust, customizable, and efficient styling solution for web developers. Built using Sass and Sass partials, this framework allows for easy customization and a consistent design across all HTML elements. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, this framework will help you achieve a polished and professional look.

## Features
1. Built with Sass
Our framework leverages the power of Sass, a CSS preprocessor that enables the use of variables, nested rules, mixins, and more. This results in cleaner, more maintainable code.

2. Customizable Variables
The framework includes a set of CSS/Sass variables that allow users to easily customize colors, fonts, spacing, and more. This flexibility ensures that you can tailor the framework to fit your project's unique branding and design requirements.

3. Themed Elements
We provide a cohesive theme for standard HTML elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout your application. The themed elements include:

Headings: Styled for clarity and hierarchy.

Lists: Both ordered and unordered lists are beautifully presented.

Buttons: Multiple button styles for different actions.

Forms: Input fields, text areas, and labels are styled for usability.

Tables: Clean and organized table styles for data presentation.

4. ## Utility Classes
To streamline your styling process, we offer a variety of utility classes for common styling needs, including:

Color: Easily apply background and text colors.
Font Weight: Control the weight of your text.
Font Size: Adjust the size of your text with predefined classes.
Margin and Padding: Quickly set spacing around elements.
Border: Apply borders with different styles and widths.
5. Consistent Design
The framework ensures that all elements are styled consistently, creating a harmonious and appealing user interface. This consistency enhances user experience and improves the overall aesthetic of your web project.

6. Compiled CSS
A compiled version of the CSS Framework is included in the repository, allowing you to quickly integrate it into your projects without needing to compile Sass yourself.
